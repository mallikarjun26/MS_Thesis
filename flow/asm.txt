- model with parameters
    - try to find the parameters which makes the model fit the data

- template matching 
- hand crafted model
- fourier series to represent the shape 
- active contour models -> minimize energy of curves. No strict constraints. Might perform well on cell 

- bottom up approach difficult in converging


- So model with some parameter
- Iteratievely figure out the next best Y after taking care of theta, scale and translation
