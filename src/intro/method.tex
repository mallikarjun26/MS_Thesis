“Represent all the data with a nonparametric model rather than trying to
summarize it with a parametric model, because with very large data sources, the
data holds a lot of detail... Now go out and gather some data, and see what it can
do.”

The above statement is more so true when the data at hand is diverse at many fronts. In our case, 
the data is the face images which can have variations in terms of age, gender, expression, pose, 
facial structure etc. Trying to come up with a parametric model which holds all these information
leads to poorly performing systems. Also whenever there is new data, the model has to be updated
which is not so efficient. Rather its better to go with the data driven solutions.

Consider coming up with a generic model which represents an eye. Since the model has to perform
in all different scenarios, we need to train the model with all possible variations. The samples
could have variations with respect to the type of eyes, open or closed, visible or occluded, in 
frontal or profile view. When these samples are represented in appearance space, they end up in 
subspaces far apart. Training a model to capture all the above variations will be difficult. We
could think of coming up with separate model for each of the variation above, but coming up with 
the labelled data for all these variations is tedious task. 

For face fiducial detection, we employ exemplar based approach to select the best solution 
from among outputs of regression and mixture of trees based algorithms (which we call candidate 
algorithms). We show that by using a very simple SIFT and HOG based descriptor, it is possible to 
identify the most accurate fiducial outputs from a set of results produced by candidate algorithms 
on any given test image. We also propose two different ways in which the exemplars can be selected
and provide analysis of how the performance is affected in choosing between two methods.

For face frontalizatio, we employ an exemplar based approach to find the transformation that relates 
the profile view to the frontal view, and use it to generate realistic frontalizations. Our method 
does not involve estimating 3D model of the face, which is a common approach in previous work in 
this area. This leads to an efficient solution, since we avoid the complexity of adding one more 
dimension to the problem.
