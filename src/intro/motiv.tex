Computer vision as a field includes making inference out of images and videos. There has been decades of research 
happening in this field. We have seen fruitful applications achieved in various domains. Be it 
reconstruction of 3D world which helps in automatic car navigation, analysis of medical images for 
early detection of diseases, analysis of astronimical images to study universe in general, biometric
systems for security purposes using finger print or face images. Even though there has been decades of 
research, problems mentioned above are not completely solved as there is demand for more precision
and efficient solutions. Technological advancement from other ends such as camera capablilites,
computational capacity aids in solving problems which were not feasible earlier.

In this thesis, we are going to concentrate on approaches and applications on face images. We have seen
a lot of generic problems such as face detection, face recognition, expression detection, gaze
identification, face renactment \etc  currently being under research and also deployed in various 
systems. Most of the above system depends on pre-processing steps such as representation, face fiducial 
detection, tranformation \etc which influences the effectiveness to a great extent. Specifically in this
thesis we consider the problem of face fiducial detection and face frontalization whose approach are 
used as pre-processing steps.

Most challenging aspect of face recognition or verification system is to handle the variation in 
pose. Assume if there is method to perfectly allign all the faces to one space such that the eyes,
ears, nose, mouth \etc of all the faces fall on the same location, recognition and verification
can be done with a simple KNN approach. Schroff \etal ~\cite{conf/cvpr/SchroffKP15} relies on a purely data driven 
approach to attain invariance to pose. This method is suitable when there is large data. 
Zhenyao \etal \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ZhuLWT14} employ a deep network to \textit{warp} faces into a canonical 
frontal view and then learn CNN that classifies each face. Sun \etal~\cite{NIPS2014_5416} relies on 
extracting features from different face patches to counter pose variation. Facial fiducials help in
aligned feature representation as we could extract feature corresponding to various key points on 
the face independent of overall pose and hence achieve invariability to pose. 

Face expression detections such as Chew \etal \cite{conf/fgr/ChewLLSCS11}, Valstar \etal \cite{Valstar:2006:FAF:1153172.1153856} 
use face fiducial detection as their starting point of the system. 

Similarly for an expression 
detection system, statistical distribution facial landmarks with each other helps in predecting 
accurate expression. Even the gender detection system would need facial landmarks as their initial 
point as fiducials are in general differently distributed for different gender.

% Consider a basic face recognition system. To have the representation of an individual's face as a 
% model, we need to be sure the representation of face has to be aligned to get a meaningful model. 
% Face fiducial detection is used as a pre-processing step to extract the features at the corresponding
% locations while building the model. 

Other pre-processing step which we discuss in this thesis is face frontalization. Given a profile
view face, a frontal view face is synthesized. This approach helps in improving the accuracy of 
face recognition system as the profile view faces would result in degraded performance. It is
also used for face renactment where video of a person can be mimicked by replacing the face with
another.
