%     - Whole chapter dedicated to discuss the problem of face frontalization, 
%       usecases of the approach proposed. We also compare it with a recently 
%       proposed method and also provides experiments for comparison.

In this chapter, we introduced the problem and also the motivation
in choosing the aforementioned problems along with the contributions.
The rest of the thesis is divided into four more chapters. Chapter 2 briefly introduces the
fundamental concepts which are used in the thesis. Chapter 3 describes in detail
about the face fiducial detection which includes defining the problem, related work, 
approaches proposed and quantitative comparative experiments. Similarly Chapter 4 deals
with face frontalization in detail pertaining to the problem definition, previous methods
proposed, our approach, qualitative and quantitative results. And finally we end with
conclusion which lead to the future direction of the work in Chapter 5.
