In this thesis, we have proposed exemplar based approaches for face fiducial detection and frontalization.
We showed that our approaches in general outperform \textit{state-of-the-art} methods on popular datasets.
We believe when the data at hand is diverse to a great extent but and single model can not capture the 
diversity, it's better to go for exemplar based approaches.
