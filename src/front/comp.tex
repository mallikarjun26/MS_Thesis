Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative_result2} shows the comparative results between our method and that
of Hassner {\em et al.}~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HassnerHPE14} for PIWFDS dataset. To show that our exemplar database is generic enough to extend to standard datasets, we provide qualitative results for LFPW~\cite{fiducials_cvpr2011} dataset in Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative_result1}. We use Hassner {\em et al.} publicly released code
to obtain the result. 
%  This method uses Zhu {\em et al.}~\cite{Ramanan:2012:FDP:2354409.2355119}
%  method to obtain the landmarks on the face.

Observe ghost like appearances present in most of
the cases from Hassner {\em et al.}~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HassnerHPE14} output. Also take into consideration, that the face
structure of the actress in second row has been changed to a generic one. This is because they use a
generic {\sc 3d} model of the face to achieve the result.
