We proposed an efficient algorithm to synthesize a frontal view of the face without the 
problem of estimating 3D model of the face. Improving the quality of results would simply
mean addition of distinct faces to the exemplar database. Automatic detection of distinct
faces can be achieved by employing \textit{state-of-the-art} face fiducial detectors to 
the newly seen face structures. k-d tree data structure can be used to make efficient search 
in the exemplar database. Also method proposed, can be easily extended to create face 
reenactment videos and other novel face image synthesis.
